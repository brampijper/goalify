# Goalify

This project was part of the BSSA course where we thought of a web-application that could motivate people to explore different parts of Amsterdam. The user can view different goals on a map where he can navigate to (with Google Maps routing). When the user is close to a goal he can perform the task and complete it to recieve points.

All goals are unique with different gradings. The user can choose for team Cat or for team Dog so they 'fight' against each other on the leaderboard.
